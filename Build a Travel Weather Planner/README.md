For this lab, you will use conditional statements to determine whether commuting is possible based on the weather, the distance to travel, and the availability of a vehicle.

Objective: Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You should create the following variables:
1. distance_mi (a number representing the distance to travel in miles)

2. is_raining (a boolean representing if the user is currently experiencing rainy weather)

3. has_bike (a boolean representing if the user has a bicycle)

4. has_car (a boolean representing if the user has a car)

5. has_ride_share_app (a boolean representing if the user has an app that allows them to request a ride)

• You should use conditional statements to determine whether commuting is possible based on the values of these variables.

• You should use if, elif, and else statements to evaluate the distance categories in ascending order.

• If distance_mi is a falsy value:
You should print False.

• If the distance is less than or equal to 1 mile:
You should print True only if it is not raining.
Otherwise, you should print False.

• If the distance is greater than 1 mile and less than or equal to 6 miles:
You should print True only if the person has a bike and it is not raining.
Otherwise, you should print False.

• If the distance is greater than 6 miles:
You should print True if the person has a car or has a ride-share app.
Otherwise, you should print False.
